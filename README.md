# node-gpt-repl

## About

`node-gpt(1)` is a Node.js REPL with built-in GPT3 completion. It also adds a further convenience in which if you `require()` a package that you haven't previously installed it will automatically install it with __npm__!

## Installation

```
$ npm install -g node-repl-gpt
```

## Usage

As you can see from the demo below the results are pretty crappy at the moment, but I think the idea is solid. Contributions welcome!
